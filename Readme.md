# 🖼️ Neural Style Transfer (Pretrained Model)

This project demonstrates **Neural Style Transfer (NST)** — a technique that applies the style of one image (e.g., a painting) to the content of another (e.g., a photo), using a pretrained convolutional neural network.

## 🚀 Features

- Transfer artistic styles from famous paintings onto your own images
- Uses a **pretrained VGG19 model**
- Simple interface for applying NST to any content and style image
- Customizable parameters for fine-tuning results
